Self Writing HTML Challenge
===========================

1. Create an html file that outputs itself.
2. The file mist pass the following tests...
  1. When the output is copied from the browser it can replace the source, so that when reloaded, the output looks the same.
  2. The solution MUST validate.
  3. The solution MUST work from a file:// URL
  4. The solution MUST NOT use the view-source: URL scheme.
3. Aim for as few characters as possible.

JS, CSS, Crowbars, whatever are all fair game - we'd like to see what you come up with.
